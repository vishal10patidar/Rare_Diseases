Technologies Used:
Python: The primary programming language for developing the model and web application.
TensorFlow/Keras: A popular deep learning framework, specifically used for model creation, training, and inference.
Keras is the high-level API of TensorFlow, making it easier to build and train deep learning models.
Streamlit: A Python framework used to create web applications. It's useful for turning data science models into interactive apps with minimal code.
Google Colab (for initial development): An online platform to write and run Python code in the cloud with free access to GPUs for deep learning tasks.
ImageDataGenerator: A Keras tool for real-time data augmentation, used to preprocess images and apply transformations like rotation, flipping, and zooming during training.
NumPy and Matplotlib: Python libraries used for numerical computations (NumPy) and visualizing generated images (Matplotlib).
